# Stock-Trend-Prediction-using-LSTM-Keras

This project reads real-time stocks data from yahoo.io by taking user input of Stock Ticker.
After taking input from the user it preprocess the data and insights from it such as it's 100 days Moving Average and it's 200 days Moving Average.

In Stock trend analysis, It is very important for the investor to analyze the Moving averages over the period as it indicates the stock trend.
For example, If 100 days Moving Average is above the 200 days moving average it indicates that stock is in upward trend and vice versa.

Stock trend prediction model uses LSTM method to predict the stock price base on its previous 100 days data and deployed by using Streamlit which is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time.
